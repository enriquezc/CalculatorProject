# CalculatorProject
Small implementation of a calculator in Swift

To open the project, use the workspace, do not use the project, as the Firebase interaction will break

To see how the project works, run the emulator from Xcode. This will work to test that the apps share operations,
as you can run one emulation on model of iphone, and then the a different model and enter operations concurrently to 
see that they are shared

Landscape orientation is locked, as the code to make the UI suitable for landscape would have added too much overhead. 
In the future, I would have added more functions to fill a landscape mode, mirroring the native calculator on the iPhone
